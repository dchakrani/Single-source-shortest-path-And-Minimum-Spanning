# Algorithms-DataStructure

This project consist of Dijsktra and Kruskal Algorithm, their time complexity and their total cost in directed and undirected graph

#Description
This project is coded in java.

# Usage
In order to run this application you must do the following things installed on your machine:

    -Java 
    -IDE to run your application (preferably Eclipse).

#Overview:

##Main Flow of Application
Dijsktra.java files holds main method which calls different sorting algorithms of different class files by creating objects.

	-Run Dijkstra.java file to run the code 
	-User will be asked if they want to run Dijkstra or kruskal algorithm 
	-User will enter 1 or 2 as input and Execution will begin and suitable output will be printed along with runtime and total cost
